      Rapidly prototype strategically-aligned processes for implementation

      strategy you can actually execute? To do strategic IT, you’ve got to
      have a strategy! Ideally, you need one that’s easy to understand and

    <h3 className="title">A Short Description</h3>

    <p>
      A customer-centric way of doing business is a way that provides a
      positive customer experience before and after the sale in order to
      drive repeat business, enhance customer loyalty and improve business
      growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, a customer-centric company is more than a company that offers
      good service. Both Amazon and Zappos are prime examples of brands
      that are customer-centric and have spent years creating a culture
      around the customer and their needs. Their commitment to delivering
      customer value is genuine – In fact, Zappos is happy to fire
      employees if they do not fit within their customer-centric culture!
    </p>

    <p>
      But, how important is being customer-centric? The good news is
      that’s becoming very important! Econsultancy recently asked what the
      most important characteristic is in order to establish a truly
      “digital-native” culture. The answer to that question and leading
      the responses with 58% was to be customer-centric.
